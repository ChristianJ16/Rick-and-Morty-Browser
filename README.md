I am building a website that allows you to search up an episode number for Rick and Morty and it will tell you some details for the episode.

I used the Fetch API to pull data from the Rick and Morty API that I'm using for this project. 

I created a random image button that will show you random pictures of Rick and Morty. I used an addEventListener for this that repsonds to a 'click'. I created an array of the images of Rick and Morty and then created a randomizer using Math.random to choose an image at random when the button is clicked.

The approach I took to get this project completed was I started off by making all my .html, .js, and .css we're all linked properly. My next step was to get the website to use the API data successfully. Then I chose which keys I wanted to be displayed and added them in the .js. Then I had to figure out to make the random image button. Once the core functionalities of the website were there is when I decided to focus a bit more on the CSS.
